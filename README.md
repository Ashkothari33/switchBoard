Basic control over Samsung SmartTVs from 2011 onward via TCP web sockets using Node.js.

Setup
---
Download the source, edit js/config.js to reflect your node server IP and mac address, your TV IP and your desired port to hit when you visit the remote.  Run node app.js then visit your node page.  Run a command from the remote and Allow access on your TV.

Thank you to the people that sorted out how to write to the Samsung TVs and paving the way for me to port this to node: http://forum.samygo.tv/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=1792
Also thanks to purecss.io and fontawesome.io for their assets.
