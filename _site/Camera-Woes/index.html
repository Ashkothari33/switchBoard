  <h1>Camera Woes</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>The other week, the Foscam I’d been using for a number of years blew up.  It had an audible “pop” as something inside decided to give up.  I went on the hunt for a camera I could replace it with and found it to be pretty difficult.  Most are now using h.264 since it has much better quality than mjpeg - but it comes at the cost of compatibility.  For web stuff, mjpeg is pretty tough to beat, as long as you don’t care too too much about the quality - so I figured that was what I was aiming for.  Foscam - and their new company Amcrest - both have switched over entirely to h.264.  So that’s not a great option for this use-case.</p>

<p>I’ve opted to buy a couple D-Link DCS-5222L HD cameras.  They have very similar specs to the old Foscam, but the software seems more refined.  I have some basic controllers set up to pan / tilt / go to preset locations but haven’t hooked up streaming, DVR or anything else yet.</p>

<p>They have their own integration problems, though.  Chrome has removed the ability to embed Basic Auth assets.  This means that I cannot directly reference the D-Link camera feed to the browser in the SwitchBoard interface.  As I can get the Basic Auth from node, I’m intending to pipe that output to a locale endpoint on the SwitchBoard instance.  We’ll see if that works and what the performance impact will be.  The interface already lazy loads and unloads dynamic images - so if you’re not viewing the image, it should automatically cease streaming.</p>

<p>If you’re shopping for a camera, I’d hold off on a recommendation from me here, but these seem promising.  I just wish they allowed the authentication to be sent via GET params.  Even if done optionally, it’d widen the usefulness for when run on a secured network.  If the piping works efficiently enough, it’s just as well - it’ll help conceal credentials to the interface.  While that isn’t a value-add for me, maybe it is for someone else.</p>

<p>I also intend to start picking at Lutron integration again - but no promises on delivering something usable.</p>
