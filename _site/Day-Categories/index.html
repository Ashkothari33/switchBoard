    <p>I’ve been making a lot of use from the machine learning aspects of SwitchBoard lately.  It’s been pretty handy (and sometimes borderline spooky) when a light turns on the second you think you want it on, without any explicit interactions at all.  While the good outweigh the bad actions by a fair margin, there have been a few notable “oh, that’s not good” moments.  Specifically when someone is asleep and a light turns on because Sunday is a weekend, I stay up late on weekends, and it’s 11:30pm…a work night.  Not good.</p>

<p>Clearly, I needed to add some additional buckets of data to sort events into so that it’s clear that my Friday and Saturday nights, where I stay up late, are different than Sunday nights, where I go to bed at a reasonable hour.  Or what about those that work schedules that have their days off on days other than weekends?  I’ve just committed code to go from simple weekday/weekend time categories to one for each day of the week.</p>

<p>All good, right?  Well, there are some drawbacks.  One big caveat is that, if you were using the machine learning up till now, you’ll have to rename your cache/db/processed.json file and restart SwitchBoard to let it generate the new processed file - which can take quite a while (on a Pi, maybe measured in hours depending on the amount of data).  I have about 10 months of data being processed.  The resulting file has roughly tripled in size.  As this file is stored in memory, you can expect about ~20MB of additional memory to be consumed if you consider my usage a yardstick.  Beyond this, since there are more discrete time categories in which events may be logged, you’ll need up to 5x more data logged before actions will be reliably learned.  I may tweak the default config settings to be a bit more loose as it begins to learn, allowing people to see actions sooner, even if they’re maybe not nearly as accurate as we’d like.</p>

<p>This is just an experiment to see if the costs outweigh the benefits.  I expect this to be a positive change, given the accuracy and memory footprint.  The time to learn has increased a bunch, but I think the long-term benefits are pretty good.  While I would like to use both - broader categories for the early days of learning and the more granular as it begins to learn more about your patterns, I think a clean solution that doesn’t unnecessarily consume too much memory probably isn’t worth the effort.</p>

<p>Once I think I’ve found the sweet-spot for the config defaults, I’ll roll out npm package 0.3.0.</p>
