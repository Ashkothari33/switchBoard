      <div class="entry">
        <p>If you’re reading this, you’re probably already sold on the benefits of home automation.  You’re also, statistically, probably not disabled.  Those with accessibility needs have the most to gain from many newer technologies.  While having a home automation system is handy when I’m too lazy to get off the couch to turn off a light or turn on the air conditioner, the cost of those interactions saved are relatively minor, they may be much more expensive - or even impossible for others.</p>

      <h1><a href="/switchBoard/App-Types/">App Types</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>One of the most powerful features of any home automation system is the ability to trigger specific actions based on a device event that has fired.  There have been a number of custom apps built within SwitchBoard to offer some handy functionality right out of the box.  Many offer ways to simply “announce” a specific action or state.  As these may change between different devices, they’ve been made specific in use, but all share some common code.  Maybe you’d like to get an SMS when your 3d print finishes, get a desktop notification when there’s a new article posted on a blog or give a voice alert if your Travis CI build fails.  They’re all in there.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>When I speak to people about getting into home automation, one of their first responses is that they don’t want to go through all the expense to buy smart devices.  Maybe they rent their home and don’t want the hassle of setting things up to only have to tear it out later.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Sometimes, maintaining a complex piece of code that relies on third parties for code dependencies, APIs or software support can come with some significant risks and disadvantages.  Some of these can be mitigated while others must be either addressed or abandoned.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Several years ago, I gave a talk about Home Automation and the very beginnings of SwitchBoard (before that’s what it was called).  Many of my initial beliefs still stand true as a direction and aims for the project.</p>

      <h1><a href="/switchBoard/Install/">Installation</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>To use SwitchBoard, you’ll need a working version of node.js and npm.  As node.js can run on a wide variety of platforms, I won’t go into the specifics of getting that set up.  There’s documentation available for most platforms that can do a better job of describing all the details there.  If you do have issues, I’m happy to try and point you in the right direction, though.</p>
