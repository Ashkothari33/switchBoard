    <p>I’ll be honest.  I’ve got a touch of paranoia.  With everyone with their newfangled Google Alexas and whatnot, I just want to go back to a simple home automation like my forebears built with their bare hands.  With that, I’ve lately been spending more time trying to minimize outside exposure.  This comes in a few areas: creating devices that don’t require APIs so I can, for example, ween off SmartThings.  Although SmartThings is a great product for what it is, I think it’s fair to say that if you’re compiling node.js on your Pi in pursuit of a home automation system - it might not be exactly what you’re looking for.</p>

<p><img src="/switchBoard/images/dependencies/dependencies.png" alt="Very few remaining dependencies." title="Very few remaining dependencies" /></p>

<p>Secondly, I’m trying to reduce dependencies.  Some, near as I can tell, are pretty unavoidable.  If you install your modules with <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm i --production</code>, you’ll install only two immediate dependencies, with a total of ten total dependencies.  As node.js does not natively allow XML parsing, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2js">xml2js</a> is used for RSS / Atom feeds and Roku support.  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/websocket">Websocket</a> is used for…well, connecting via websockets.</p>

<p>I had been using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/request">request</a> but removed it as it wasn’t a huge burden to bake in that functionality, it had a lot of dependencies at 57 and had a (very minor) security issue with a dependency that took long enough to address, it was easier for me to just axe the whole thing.</p>

<p>SwitchBoard is written to be simple.  As my use-case isn’t terribly advanced, it’s often easy enough to just write my own little bits of code to get around having a relatively oversized dependency.  While this wouldn’t fly if I were being paid to do this work; as a hobby, I find it more interesting this way.  This is in no way suggesting that my own code is more secure or better than those that it depends on - but at least this way, if issues are found, I’m able to address the code myself.  Like grandpa used to do.</p>
