            Welcome to SwitchBoard.  If you're seeing this message, it means you've got everything set up and you'll just need to configure your remote.
          </p>
          <p>
            Open up the config/config.js file which contains a series of standard device types.  Find any device that looks like one you'd like configured and plug in your relevant information.  For anything that's maybe not super obvious, there should be ample comments to help guide you.  While you're in there, you may also want to mark the "welcome" device as disabled: true to prevent this message from showing up anymore.
