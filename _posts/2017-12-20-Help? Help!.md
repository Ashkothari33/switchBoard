### I Need Help!
Having trouble getting SwitchBoard set up?  Are you just interested in asking some questions to know if it'll fit your needs?  Maybe you only care about part of the code and want to repurpose it for some other project - or just have some general home automation questions totally unrelated to this code.  Regardless, I'm happy to help as much as I'm able.  The best places to reach out are:

* File a [Git Issue](https://github.com/imbrianj/switchBoard/issues/new)
* Send an email to [brian@bevey.org](mailto:brian@bevey.org)
* Join the [IRC Channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#%23switchboard) or use the chat embedded below.

### How Can I Help?
You can reach out with the same contact methods above.  If you have a device you'd like to add, are able to help test / write code, have a device you'd like to send me (even if it's just a loan), translation, design feedback - all are welcome!
