If you're reading this, you're probably already sold on the benefits of home automation.  You're also, statistically, probably not disabled.  Those with accessibility needs have the most to gain from many newer technologies.  While having a home automation system is handy when I'm too lazy to get off the couch to turn off a light or turn on the air conditioner, the cost of those interactions saved are relatively minor, they may be much more expensive - or even impossible for others.

If you are bedridden, how would you adjust the temperature of your thermostat?  If you are blind, how would you ensure your living room light is off after your guests have left?  If you lack fine motor control - either through missing limbs and using an alternate input device or lack of fine control, could you imagine having difficulties in effectively use your TV remote?

I've spent quite a bit of time trying to put myself in the shoes of people with different disabilities.  I've tried, to the best of my ability, to create systems that try to make their lives just a little easier.  I don't always succeed, but I think it's important for anyone developing systems to keep this in mind.

While home automation is a neat toy that brings security, energy efficiency and convenience features, it's a tool that could have profound impact for others.
